# Java-simple-shooting-game
A simple 2D (board actually) gun shooting game. Written in Java language with GUI. It has an online part which I haven't implemented yet. 
The main part of this project is using GUI and threads in Java. I worked a little bit with files too.

The first page of the game. I took this screen shot while running the program in Eclipse IDE, hence the background is part of my code in Eclipse.

This is the setting page wich you can choose the length of dimentions of the board and the proportion of trenches.

This is the game itself. The blue triangle is you, red ones are enemies (the enemies also are enemy of each other and kill each other). At first each of you have 3 lives. Yellow cells are trenches which you can't shoot or move through.

Every 20 seconds, a life will appear on a random cell of the board and you can gain one more life by eating the heart(life). Maximum number of lives is 4.
